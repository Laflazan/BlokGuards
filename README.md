# 🛡️ BLOCKGUARDS
### Time-Locked Temporary Wallets & QR-Based Payments (Stellar Powered)

BLOCKGUARDS is a next-generation fintech app that allows users to generate temporary, time-locked wallets with spending limits. Each temporary wallet can be shared via secure QR codes, and automatically closes when the time expires.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1️⃣ Time-Locked Temporary Wallets
- Create a wallet that expires in 1–30 minutes  
- Choose your spending limit (e.g., 10 XLM max)  
- Auto-closes when the timer ends  
- No permanent private key sharing — fully secure  

### 2️⃣ Spending Limit Controls
- Give someone limited spending permission  
- Ideal for:  
  - Kids’ allowance  
  - One-time shared shopping  
  - Quick friend-to-friend spending  
  - Temporary access instead of sending full funds  

### 3️⃣ QR-Based Wallet Sharing
- Generates a unique QR code for each temporary wallet  
- Scan to activate spending rights  
- Works online & offline  
- Optional **offline-secure token** mode  

### 4️⃣ MoneyGram → Stellar Cash Load
- Load cash through MoneyGram into your Stellar wallet  
- Bank-free onboarding  
- Instant availability

## 🧩 Real-World Use Cases
- Small merchants without POS systems  
- Street vendors / pop-up stores  
- Shared shopping budgets  
- Controlled kid spending  
- Limited emergency access  
- Temporary permissions without full wallet access  

---

## 🏦 Why BLOCKGUARDS?
Traditional wallets give **full control**.  
Bank QR codes expose **identity**.  
Crypto wallets require **private key trust**.

BLOCKGUARDS introduces a new layer of security:

✔ Temporary  
✔ Limited  
✔ Revocable  
✔ Secure  
✔ Stellar-Native  

A safer way to let someone pay on your behalf — without sharing your wallet.
